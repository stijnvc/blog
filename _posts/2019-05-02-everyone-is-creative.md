*A short essay about creative leadership and the reluctance to change.*

I like to believe that **everyone** is creative. If you pay attention you can see creativity at work in most people's daily lives. Even completing some of the most mundane tasks can require creativity. The rather broad definition of creativity lends itself to being applied to all sorts of phenomena. In de context of this essay I like to think of it as the ability to come up with new ideas.

Besides, the problem is not whether people are creative or not, but rather their willingness to participate and act on their creativity at the desired moments. Especially when trying to involve people into the creative process who are high up in the decision making hierarchy within companies I experience this unwillingness.

My hypothesis is that when people enter a position of leadership they start feeling obliged to always have a strong and certain answer: a workable (or sometime unworkable) truth for people to take as an answer to their questions. Many times this truth is not wrong. Many people in leadership positions have great expertise in their field. Though a problem arises when there is a need for change, creativity and innovation.

The certainty in the stance people in authoritative roles think they have to take for people to see them as worthy leaders is going directly against the basis of creativity and innovation: curiosity and questioning what already is. As higher levels of abstraction in creative thinking leads designers to more discontinuous solutions to problems, design starts to claim more and more of the decision making process. This shift in what informs the decision making in a company is often blocked, dooming a company to slowly stagnate their innovation and become irrelevant.

Many companies who have welcomed design into the decision making process of their company have become very successful. But sometimes the discontinuous solutions can be too confronting. In such a case it is deemed a better idea to just continue the way the company was already going, avoiding confrontation. A company like this does not have to immediately become irrelevant but can continue on for a long time and become a toxic and frustrating environment for curious designers and other creative thinkers.

In my opinion creativity should be at the core of every business. Once discontinuous ideas start eating away at the foundation of a company it is time to start breaking down the old and build something new besides it. Change can be motivated by raising awareness and empathy; Develop aspirations by showing people what could be and work together to get there.

Trust the creative process.

Struggling with this phenomenon on daily basis triggered me to write this essay. It is based on experiences and stories of creative people working in creatively stagnated companies and my reading into creativity, abstraction and playing in the context of design.
