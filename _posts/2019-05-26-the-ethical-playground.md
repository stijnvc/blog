There are a lot of challenges in designing public playgrounds. If it’s not the ambiguity of play and the difficulty for adults to understand children, then the safety norms and regulations will surely give designers a hard time. These safety regulations are so strict that they almost dictate what play equipment should look like. For this reason designers are having difficulty coming up with new and original concepts for play equipment.

While there are good reasons for strict safety regulations, they are also kind of ironic. As one of the main benefits from playing is that by taking risks, children can test the limits of their physical, intellectual and social development (Little, H. and Wyver, S., 2008). By taking risks, skills are practiced until children master them.

But even with this fact, it still seems ethically wrong for designers to construct an environment where children might hurt themselves. Where is the line between safe enough and too dangerous for children to play? This is a hard question to answer. But what if we didn’t have too? There already exists an exciting environment with endless play value and free of safety regulations: nature.

Nature far exceeds play safety regulations. The trees that children love to climb would never pass safety evaluation tests — but still we accept them as suitable play equipment. Maybe we accept the risks of nature, because we didn’t design it. But this is not completely true. In a way we do design a large portion of the nature that surrounds us. If we design nature, to what extent are we responsible for the end result?
