title: Design as Art
summary: Is design a purely rational persuit?
---


In the first year of school I was thought that whoever designs something, is a designer. Even us as first year students should already refer to ourselves as designers, because we designed things. I like to think they said this to make us realise and get used to the impact we as designers can have on our environment and to learn to deal with this responsibility. But what does it mean to design something? Design is intention; A plan; A specification of an object or process. But I find this common description unsatisfying. It is just stating what a design is. To design something would just mean to conceive such an object or process with a plan and a certain intention. But why?

My perception of design has for a long time been depended on the idea that it is about capturing truth. A rational and scientific approach of looking for answers and asking why. Design is about solving problems after all, and problems can be solved with answers. This goes well as long as you draw a clear line of where to stop. At a certain point the digging for truth turns into an endless pursuit of meaning. The deepest questions end up unanswered. At that point the only answer can come from within. To make decisions designers always have to make use of their intuition, gut feeling and emotions. Therefore it would be ignorant to not think of a designer as an artist. It is useless to look at design as a completely rational pursuit.

I want to try and define design as a part of the arts. Defining art and design on their own provides little insight to me. I’m convinced that defining them both relative to each other will enable a much richer definition.

You can look at art as everything you don’t have to do. It is about proposing new worlds and ideas. For example, a painter like Van Gogh proposes a way of perceiving the world through his paintings. The painting is a material artefact of the idea he is presenting. We as humans need these proposals to challenge our current ideas. Without them we would be standing still. But because of the limits of the material world it is still enabled by pragmatic and rational decision making and is therefore, just like design, an intellectual pursuit. Art can almost seem like design without concessions.

Design, unlike art, can have a vague sense of urgency. There is a problem that needs to be solved. It fulfils _needs_ with _function_ that people _use_. This can seem like quite a rigid definition. However, the terms _needs_ and _function_ are completely relative and open for interpretation. As Charles Eames famously said: "Who ever said that pleasure wasn’t functional?" To me, this is a very liberating quote. But design still feels more defined and rigid than art. A tangible reason for this rigidity is the fact that relative to art it has more variables that are outside of the control of the conceiver. Design is more constrained by the limits of business and industry, whose needs have very little empathy for the emotional aspects of a design.

But design is also about new ideas. Right now there is a trend in design of calling coming up with new ideas _innovation_. Innovation in its essence is, just like art, about proposing new ideas. Where design differentiates itself from art is the fact that it does not only propose a new world, it creates one. Art expresses its ideas about this world with perceivable materialisations, while design turns its ideas about this world into reality. Design creates the new world.

But this is oversimplified. The definition of art and design are both up for debate. As they should be—both concern themselves with new ideas. In reality there is no hard line between art and design. There is no fixed point where design turns into art or vice versa. It is a constant discussion. You can see it as a gradient in which the terms art and design define the degrees of freedom. Art being less rigid than design. This gradient can cross many domains. Nothing is ever 100% design or art. Both concern themselves with creation and they both, at a certain point, get confronted with the limits of our world and have to look for pragmatic answers. They enable new ideas based on questioning our current world and are both essential, for the need for change is what connects us all.
